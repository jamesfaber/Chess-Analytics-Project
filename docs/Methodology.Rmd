# Methodology

Using the chess.com API, I was able to extract a random sample of 5,800 completed 10-minute chess games from players around the world. 

Players were chosen if their skill level was within a range of 900-1100 rating points, as my skill level was 1000. No player was represented more than one time, and no games that ended as a draw were kept because I wanted to analyze games that ended decisively.


Example response from the chess.com API for a single game:

As you can see, there is a large amount of information available for each chess game. Some data such as player rating is easily accessible, however the data for each move is stored in a text string, so Regular Expressions were used to extract this. The result is a list of each move in algebraic notation:

This process was done for each of the 5,800 games in the sample. The code for this can be found in the file "Gathering Data & Feature Engineering.ipynb"
