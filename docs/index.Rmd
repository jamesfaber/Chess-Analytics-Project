# Project Overview

As an avid chess player, Iâ€™m always eager to explore new strategies and refine my skills. I play mainly on chess.com, which is the most popular chess website in the world. Usually, my games are against human opponents, and I like to play with the settings that each player has 10 minutes to make all their moves.

My goal for this project was to determine if I could find any insights from other players' games that could help me win more often. To do this, I needed to get a large sample of completed chess.com games, engineer features that could potentially explain why someone won their game, and lastly run a model to determine which features were significant and interpret them.
